          <h3>Gift Cards as a Business Currency System</h3>
          <p><br>Gift card balances, airline miles, loyalty points are currencies issued by businesses, backed by their products and services. In the modern era, business currencies have been used for a range of purposes beyond gifting, such as charitable giving, payment of wages, legal settlements. They are important tools to reward brand loyalty, encourage consumption, generate new sales, and even raise capital. <br><br>However, gift cards still run on archaic technology like Serial-PIN swipe cards, or siloed databases. It is difficult for consumers to do basic things like track or combine balances, recover lost funds, transfer balance. Secondary market, where secondhand gift cards are re-sold or exchanged, is rife with fraud. <br><br>An open, secure, and standardized gift card system on the blockchain can unlock tremendous value for consumers, businesses, and the economy. </p>

            <h5 class="h5 fst-italic">QR Gift Card - blockchain infrastructure</h5>
            <p><br>Instead of the archaic Serial # and PIN, we re-invented the gift card system with QR and blockchain technology to improve security, user experience, and features. <br><br>By scanning a QR code (on a physical card or email), users can unlock a gift card stored on a blockchain address and transfer the balance to their digital wallet address. </p>
          </div>

            <h5 class="h5 fst-italic">Digital Wallet - track balance, send and receive</h5>
            <p><br>The user's digital wallet is managed with public-private key encryption and transactions are processed on the blockchain. <br><br>In real time, users can track their balances by brand, access their transaction history, securely send and receive balances.</p>

            <h5 class="h5 fst-italic">Market Rate Exchange - DeFi</h5>
            <p><br>Blockchain tokenization enables a secure secondary market, where users can exchange their gift card balances, airline miles, loyalty points at market rate. For the financially savvy, think of this as the "Forex Market" but instead of exchanging national currencies (e.g. Dollars, Pesos), users are exchanging business currencies in the form of gift card balances, airlines miles, etc. <br><br>The exchange rate is determined by market pricing, i.e. the supply/demand from users on the platform. This floating rate mechanism is powered by blockchain DeFi (decentralized finance) technology. </p>

        <div class="col-lg-5 col-sm-12">
          <p>Check out some cool use cases of business currencies (on right). Airline miles can be donated to affiliated charity organziations. Some companies, esp in the cryptocurrency space, have started paying employees and suppliers in the currency they issue. For example, the BNB tokens issued by Binance can be used to pay for exchange fees and participate in the Binance ecosystem. Chick Fil-A has been legally approved to pay out settlement claims in their gift card balances. Businesses like Verizon and Target have launched various initiatives to cross-sell to customers using gift cards as incentives.</p>

          <p>Complementary currency system is a concept that is supported by recent academic research in economics. The works by Professor Bernard Lietaer have been seminal in the design and proposal of this project. A currency system, issued by businesses and backed by their products and services, can increase economic activity in times of stability and be the "spare tire" in times of crisis.<br><br>Former Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan says he "envisages proposals in the near future for issuers of electronic payment obligations, such as stored-value cards or digital cash to set up specialised issuing corporations with strong balance sheets and public credit ratings" and he foresees "new private currency markets in the 21st century".</p>
